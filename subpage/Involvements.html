        <h6> Public speaking has always been something I’ve wanted to improve. Every few months, I challenge myself to try something new that pushes my boundaries. One day, I got an email
             from an organization I’d volunteered with in Boston. They were looking for a woman in STEM to share her story on TV. I thought, why not go all in with conquering my fear?
            I signed up, auditioned, and spent the next few months training as a storyteller, crafting a story centered on femininity and womanhood in the STEM workplace. When the day 
            finally arrived, nerves hit me hard! I questioned why I had put myself in such a vulnerable position but my friends and partner were in the audience, the show had to go on.
            I was shaky, less animated than usual, and stumbled over a few words. The live audience definitely noticed—but thankfully, post-production is a beautiful thing.

        <h6>Did you know that Black and Latina women make up only 4% of scientists and engineers in the U.S.? I had the honor of speaking at a fireside chat at MIT as part of the 
            “Only 4%” campaign with Science Club for Girls in Boston. As a Hispanic woman in engineering, I shared my story and the challenges that come with navigating a space where we’re 
            still underrepresented. Systemic barriers and limited access to resources can make it easy for young girls to feel discouraged or believe they don’t belong in STEM. 
            That’s why conversations like these—and the mentorship and support they spark—are so important. I left the event feeling inspired by the women I met and their visions 
            for a more diverse, inclusive future in STEM. Little by little, through advocacy, visibility, and action, we’re working to raise that 4%—and build a community where everyone belongs.

            While I lived in Cambridge, each week I volunteered at a local elementary school through Science Club for Girls, an organization dedicated to empowering young girls 
            through hands-on STEM education. Alongside a team of other STEM professionals, I taught engaging lessons that explored various fields of 
            engineering, from mechanical to environmental to biomedical. Our goal was to spark curiosity, build confidence, and expose the girls to real-world 
            applications of STEM in a supportive and inspiring environment.

            I had the incredible honor of speaking on a panel at MIT in partnership with the IF/THEN® She Can initiative, 
            an organization dedicated to uplifting and empowering women in STEM. The event was an introduction event for their inspiring exhibit featuring 
            life-sized 3D-printed statues of real women scientists and innovators, each a powerful symbol of representation and possibility.
            Discussing the future of STEM at this panel was an unforgettable experience, and I’m proud to contribute to a movement that’s shaping the next
            generation of women in STEM.

        <h6>
            As a STEM professional volunteer with Science ATL’s Imagining the Future Day, I partnerned with the Forest Park middle school in Atlanta. 
            I had the joy of spending time teaching students digital logic and guiding students through hands-on circuit building activities.
             Watching their faces light up as they explored how electricity works and imagined themselves as future engineers was truly rewarding.
            I also help develop STEM lesson plans for the teachers for continuing STEM lessons. I am grateful to have helped spark a love for STEM in 
            the next generation of innovators.
