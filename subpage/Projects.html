				<h3>Pomodoro Timer</h3> 
				<p class="post-meta"> 
                    #embedded #arduino #SPI #CAD #fusion360 #soloproject
				</p> 
				<p> 
					This project implements the Pomodoro study technique, a time management method based on 25 minute focused work sessions followed by 5 minute breaks. 
					The goal was to develop a dedicated, desk-mounted Pomodoro timer to enhance productivity through consistent time intervals. The device was fully designed, 
					researched, and developed by me as a personal embedded systems project. I selected an Arduino microcontroller because of its PWM pins and integrated SPI interface, 
					which enabled fast communication with the TFT display I chose to use. The system features an RGB LED for status indication, a user input button for selection, and 
					a custom 3D printed enclosure that I designed in Fusion 360.

				<h3>Automated Cat Laser</h3> 
				<p class="post-meta"> 
                    #embedded #RaspberryPi #Python #Servos #lasermodule #CAD #soloproject
				</p> 
				<p> 
					This project is an automated laser toy designed to provide interactive play and stimulation for my cat while she is home alone. It was developed using a Raspberry Pi 
					running Python, which controls a laser module and two servo motors to direct the laser across the living room floor in dynamic patterns. A custom enclosure was designed in Fusion 360.
					This project is currently being worked on and being expanded to include cameras.

				<h3>Nighttime Care Sleeve</h3> 
				<p class="post-meta"> 
					#embedded #UI/UX #UserStories #RaspberryPi #PCBdesign #groupproject
				</p> 
				<p> 
					Taking care of a newborn at night can be very difficult for parents. It can stress parents out from having to stay up all night 
					which can result to emotional problems that negatively impact a parent's whole day and their own personal relationships with others. 
					To address this, I developed a wearable device that parents can wear at night to monitor their stress levels brought about during Nighttime
					care and help soothe it through guided breathing, soothing lights and music, and encouraging messages. This project includes
					a wearable cuff with . There additionally is a baby monitor made from a microphone to monitor the audio levels where the baby is and send
					an alert when there is unrest, attached to an Op-Amp to interpret sounds digitally through the Raspberry Pi.

				<h3>Robotics Design Team</h3> 
				<p class="post-meta"> 
					#robotics #electrical #arduino #motors #teensy #leadership #groupproject
				</p>		
				<p>
					As part of a university robotics design team, I led and mentored a group of ten engineering students in the design and development of the electrical 
					system for a robotic excavator built to compete in the NASA Lunabotics competition. My primary focus was on the excavation subsystem, where I researched 
					and integrated motors, sensors, and load cells to enable effective regolith collection and measurement. This project involved close collaboration with
					 mechanical, software, and systems engineering teams to ensure full integration of the robotic platform. The result was a fully functional excavation 
					 robot designed to operate autonomously in a simulated lunar environment.

				<h3>7 Revolute Joint Robot</h3> 
				<p class="post-meta"> 
					#robotics #locomotion #roboticarm #jupyternotebook #resolved-ratecontroller #endeffector #soloproject
					
				</p> 
				<p> 
					This project involved simulating and controlling the 7-DOF KUKA iiwa 14 robotic arm to push a rubber duck across a table into a bucket. 
					A resolved-rate controller was implemented to operate in end-effector space, enabling smooth trajectory tracking without explicit joint position computation.
					The controller used PD control, Jacobian pseudo-inverse mapping, and gravity compensation to compute joint torques. The result was a stable and responsive robot 
					simulation that completed the task with smooth, continuous motion.

				<h3>COVID Capacity Counter</h3> 
				<p class="post-meta"> 
					#computervision #opencv #ssd #tensorflow #centroidtracker #humandetection #soloproject
				</p> 
				<p> 
					The COVID capacity counter project was created during the COVID times to help get real-time capacity numbers in buildings that could only hold a conversations
					percentage of occupancy. Early on, there were humans manually counting people going in and out. So, with this project a camera could be set up and my program was 
					made to capture these frames which then turned them into blobs to pass into the Mobilenet SSD to determine if there were humans present. The centroid tracker 
					algorithm by pyimagesearch was implemented to be able to detect who was going in vs who was going out and connect multiple human detections within frames as one 
					person.

				<h3>Regression Automation Tool</h3> 
				<p class="post-meta"> 
					#python #testautomation #TOML #multiprocessing #soloproject
				</p> 
				<p> 
					This project was made for test automating at work. At my job, there are multiple python tests written to exercise different parts of the device under test (DUT). 
					Sometimes, multiple tests need to be ran and in order to run them, the DUT must be connected, the test must be imported and initialized, and finally it can run.
					The automation tool I created in Python helps automate the whole process. It sets a uniform standard for test launching and enables multi-test launching as well 
					parallelization within Python tests through multiprocessing. The suite of tests can be done through TOML.
